</a>

### How do I enable OwO reminders?

- type `!r owo` / `!r hunt` / `!r pray`
- click the first red button - it should turn green and a checkmark appears

### How do I disable OwO reminders?

- type `!r owo` / `!r hunt` / `!r pray`
- click the first green button - it should turn red and a crossmark appears

### I don't want to get pinged, what do I do?

- type `!r owo` / `!r hunt` / `!r pray` / `!r custom delete`
- click the üóëÔ∏è trash button

### How do I enable / disable the huntbot reminder?

- `!r owohb on` to enable (enabled by default)
- `!r owohb off` to disable

### My huntbot reminder doesn't work, help??

- [first step](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq#step-one)
- make sure you are the only person in the server with that name (no alts)
- make sure to have your **DMS open**
- if you **don't see** a "‚è∞" reaction on your huntbot message, then you might want to [join our support server](https://discord.gg/KwfCk7r) and we'll help you

### Reaction doesn't respond to my commands??

- [first step](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq#step-one)
- @mention it and use the correct prefix `!r`
- the bot might be offline / restarting, check later with `!r ping`
- your server is in a broken shard, kick and [re-add the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=519287796549156864&scope=bot&permissions=347200)
- if you were spamming reaction bot commands then you're very likely temp-blacklisted - just wait a few minutes
- if the bot is still not responding then you're banned

### How do I get some in-depth help on a specific command?

- `!r help command`, replace `command` with an actual command name - `!r help quest` for example

### How do I enable certain custom owo patreon commands?

- type `!r custom add command`, for example `!r custom add piku`
- you can find a list of valid __commands__ by doing `!r custom`
- disable/remove commands by doing `!r custom remove piku`

### How do I set up the automatic quest system?

- set a quest channel by doing `!r s questchannel #channel` if you're a **server admin**
- set a staff (quest manager) role using `!r s queststaff @Role`
- quest managers can remove/edit quest, customize the embed, manage quest bans

### How do I add my quest to the quest list?

- saying `owo quest` in the quest channel automatically adds the quest to the list.
- you can lock your quest using `owo quest lock X` if you don't want your quest to show up

### TMP

- you can remove **your quest** by doing `!r q remove ID`, replace ID with the quest ID that can be found [here](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq/blob/main/assets/questid.png?raw=true)

### I gave @User a cookie, but the quest didn't update??

- the bot will only update quests in the quest channel

### I found an error / bug in the quest system, help?

- the quest system is fairly new, please report any bugs by doing `!r report` or by joining our [support server](https://discord.gg/KwfCk7r)

### Why is there a snail reaction on my message?

- this is an indicator that you're on a command cooldown, just wait and get familiar with the command cooldown by doing `!r help command`
- spamming commands while being on cooldown will get you temp-blacklisted

### Why is XYZ command cooldown so high??

- reaction bot is being used by many users at the same time, decreasing the cooldown would rate-limit the bot and make it even more slower

### How does the hb command work?

- do `!r help hb`
- the `-radar` tag allows you to set a radar lvl, up to 1k
- the `-patreon` tag allows you to get patreon animals
- friendly reminder: this is just a visualizer and the shown animals will not get added to your zoo
- you can set a max of 5760 animals
- example: `!r hb 5760 -patreon -250` (5760 animals, patreon animals, radar lvl 250)

### How does the owostats command work?

- enable the owohunt reminder for example (`!r owoh on`), and the number in the **grinding** field will increase every time you get mentioned by the bot

### How does the zoo command work?

- do `owo zoo` (`owo zoo display` if you sold your animals recently)
- visit discord's [Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) article and read
- after enabling the developer mode on your device/platform.. whatever, copy the message ID of your zoo (or multiple message IDs if your zoo has more than one message) and do `!r zoo MESSAGE_ID`

- example for **a single message zoo**

    <img src="https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq/blob/main/assets/zoosingle.png?raw=true" width="550">

    <img src="https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq/blob/main/assets/zoomultiple.png?raw=true" width="800">
</a>

### How does the reminder command work?

- `!r help rm`
- create a reminder using `!r rm reminder in time`
- example 1.: `!r rm owo daily in 1day`, example 2.: `!r rm do homework and read a book in 1 week and 20 h`

- delete your reminder by doing `!r rm delete ID`, get your reminder ID by doing `!r rm list`
- you can set a timezone for the reminder list by looking up your timezone [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
- you can now set your timezone by doing `!r rm timezone Australia/Melbourne` for example
