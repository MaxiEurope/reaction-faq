### How does the zoo command work?

- visit discord's [Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) article and read

![gift command emoji link example](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq/blob/main/assets/gift_cmd_emoji_link.png?raw=true)

### What are reminder variables?

- variables in reminders get replaced by the bot
- {USER} for instance will be replaced with your @User mention
- {GOAL} with your custom goal (`!r owo goal` for example)

### Reaction doesn't respond to my commands??

- [first step](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq#step-one)
- @mention it and use the correct prefix `!r`
- you might have disabled the default prefix, [see how to fix it here](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq#how-to-set-a-custom-prefix)
- the bot might be offline / restarting, check later with `!r ping`
- your server is in a broken shard, kick and [re-add the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=519287796549156864&scope=bot&permissions=347200)
- if you were spamming reaction bot commands then you're very likely temp-blacklisted - just wait a few minutes
- if the bot is still not responding then you're banned

### How to set a custom prefix?

- `!r s prefix set x` will set reaction bot's prefix to `x`
- you can remove a custom prefix using `!r s prefix remove`
- you can also remove the default `!r` prefix using `!r s default`
- ping the bot and use its @mention (@reaction s prefix) if you forgot your custom prefix
- use `@reaction s default` if you accidentally disabled the default prefix

### How do I disable reaction bot commands / reminders from a channel?

- `!r disable all` to disable ALL commands and reminders in your current channel
- you can #mention a channel to manage some other channels too
- disable specific commands/reminders using `!r disable help ping`/`!r disable r owo hunt`
- use `!r h disable` for more examples

### How do I get some in-depth help on a specific command?

- `!r help command`, replace `command` with an actual command name - `!r help quest` for example

### I found an error / bug in the bot, help?

- please report any bugs via `!r report` or by joining our [support server](https://discord.gg/KwfCk7r)
