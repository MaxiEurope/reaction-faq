# PRIVACY POLICY

To be able to use the majority of reaction bot commands/features some data is being collected.

This data is included to:
- user ids
- usernames
- guild ids
- channel ids

### USER IDS
- user IDs are being used to store user-specific/related data such as reminder settings, reminders, quest progress, reminder stats, counting stats for leaderboards, custom reminders (gifts)
- not storing user IDs would mean that reminders and their settings would not get saved along with progress lost once the bot restarts

### USERNAMES
- usernames are only stored within the automated quest helper
- this allows reaction bot to find and manage quests from OwO bots messages

### GUILD IDS
- guilds IDs are only being stored when setting up server- and quest settings
- this is being done if a server admin happens to change bot-related settings

### CHANNEL IDS
- channel IDs are only being stored if a server admin happens to disable certain reminders or commands for a channel 

**The above-mentioned data is never and will never be shared or sold.**

## UPCOMING CHANGE - AUGUST 13TH

1) All users are automatically being opt out of having their data tracked as they would need to accept our bot rules and [privacy policy](https://github.com/MaxiEurope/reaction-faq/blob/main/privacy_policy.md) via reaction bots' `!r rules` command.

2) Any reaction bot commands or features (besides `!r rules`) will NOT work if new or existing users try to run or use them. They would need to accept them first.

3) Users can access their data we've collected about them using `!r requestmydata`. This data will be shown via an [ephemeral](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000580222-Ephemeral-Messages-FAQ) message.

4) Users can request their data deletion via `!r deletemydata`. Once deleted there\'s no way to recover a user's data.



If a user happens to disagree with reaction bots policy then they can simply opt out by deleting their data via `!r deletemydata` and the bot will no longer collect and store data.
