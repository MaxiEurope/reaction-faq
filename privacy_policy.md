# PRIVACY POLICY

Reaction bot needs to collect certain discord data in order for the bot to work properly.

This data is included to:
- user ids
- guild ids
- channel ids

### USER ID
User Ids are required to save reminders, quests, reminder stats, "owo, hunt/battle, pray/curse" counters, and custom reminders.
### GUILD ID
Guild Ids are used to store server and quest-related settings.
### CHANNEL ID
Channel Ids are primarily optional and used to disable specific commands and reminders for channels.

**This data is never and will never be shared or sold.**

To delete a user's data from the bot entirely they can reach out to me or the support team for now (future command planned) to have their data removed.
